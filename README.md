# Fun Fact Generator

This Python script utilizes the PyWebIO library to create a web-based Fun Fact Generator application. It fetches random useless facts from the [Useless Facts API](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json?language=en) and displays them interactively in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyWebIO library
  ```bash
  pip install pywebio
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fun-fact-generator.git
   cd fun-fact-generator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python fun_fact_generator.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Usage

- The application will display a "Fun Fact Generator" heading with a clickable "Click me" button.
- Clicking the button will fetch a random fact from the API and display it on the page.
- Enjoy learning useless but interesting facts!

## Notes
